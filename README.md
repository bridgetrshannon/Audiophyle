- When a user searches for a musical artist, they are presented with artist information and an option to save the artist to their member page. When a user clicks on a top song from an artist, song information will display on the page. Users have the option to save the song to their profile in either a "saved songs" list or a "listen to later" list. When a user is logged in, their email is displayed in the navbar.

## Work in Progress

The following features of the Audiophyle application are works in progress or (WIP).

- When a user arrives at the home page, there is a Genre Playlists section. When a genre is clicked,the user will be taken to a playlist of songs based on that genre. We can incorporate this feature using the Spotify API.

- When a user arrives at the member page, there is a Band Merchandise section. Ideally the user can select one of there saved artists and the band merchandise links will populate with links to shirts, vinyls, and posters. We can incorporate this feature using The Bands In Town API.
